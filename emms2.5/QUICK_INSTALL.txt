Quick installation guide

1. Requirements

Apache 2+, MySQL 5+, PHP5+, PEAR, Mozilla Firefox
In a windows development workstation you should consider installing xampp (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
In a production environment we recommend a LAMP server.
PEAR libraries: DB, Auth, Date, HTML_QuickForm, HTML_Template_IT, Pager, XML_Tree, Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer
Recommended PHP settings: Safe Mode = off, max_execution_time >= 180, memory_limit >= 128M

Note: Most PEAR libraries required to run EMMS are not installed by default with xampp, to install
any PEAR library let's say 'Auth', from the command line type something like C:\PathToXammp\php\pear install Auth

2. Installation in a Windows development workstation

   a. Download the compressed .gz file with all the sources from http://code.google.com/p/emms/downloads/list
      The downloaded file should be named emms-v2.5x.tar.gz (ie.: 2.5x is the package version)
      Unpack the .gz and place it in your web root path, ie. C:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php

   b. Create the emms database.
      In order to populate the database run the sql scripts listed below:
        c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\httpdocs\emms\acro\db\tables.sql
        c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\httpdocs\emms\acro\db\views.sql
        c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\httpdocs\emms\acro\db\triggers.sql
        c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\httpdocs\emms\acro\db\data.sql
      Note: Actual paths may be different depending on your setup

   c. Edit the configuration file at c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\emms\acro\conf.ini
      The configuration settings listed below are critical to update in order for the emms to run:

      --- conf.ini excerpt begin ---

        [db]
            host = "localhost"
            name = "db_name"
            usr = "db_user"
            pwd = "db_password"

        [mod_sponsorship]
            url =  "http://localhost/php/httpdocs/emms/acro/mod_sponsorship/"

        [app]
            url = "http://localhost/php/httpdocs/emms/acro/app/"

      --- conf.ini excerpt end ---

   d.  Remove all content inside C:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\emms\acro\tmp (Must be erased whenever you change/update the conf.ini or menu.xml files)

   e. Open Mozilla Firefox and go to "http://localhost/php/httpdocs/emms/acro/app/" - same url as the one in the "app" section of your conf.ini file

	Login information
           username: admin
           password: 123456

3. Installation in a LAMP server - shared host

   a. Download the compressed .gz file with all the sources from http://code.google.com/p/emms/downloads/list
      The downloaded file should be named emms-v2.5x.tar.gz (ie.: 2.5x is the package version)
   b. Upload the "php/httpdocs/emms" folder inside the compressed .gz to your shared host,
      directly under your web root folder.
   c. Upload the "php/emms" folder inside the compressed .gz to your shared host at the same
      level as your web root folder - out of the web scope.
      The directory structure in your shared host should be something like this:

   /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/
      |
      +-- emms
      |     +-- acro
      |           +-- backup
      |           +-- custom
      |           +-- sh
      |           +-- tmp
      |           |-- conf.ini
      |           |-- menu.xml
      |
      +-- httpdocs < your web root
             +-- emms
                   +-- acro
                         +-- app
                         +-- db
                         +-- l10n
                         +-- mod_sponsorship
                         |-- favicon.ico
                         |-- index.php
                         |-- version

   If we stick to the folder structure above... make sure to allow apache write permissions to /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/emms/acro/tmp

   d. Complete steps 2.b, 2.c and 2.d above, you should adjust the paths examples accordingly.

4. Setup your task scheduler - cron

This is a critical step, especially in a real world scenario. Every day at midnight when your server clock
reaches 12.00am, EMMS will terminate any open session and will block any atempt to login until you run the
included /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/emms/sh/mysqldump-cronjob.php script from the command line
or using your system cron, the whole process usually takes less than a couple of minutes to complete,
exact time depends on your loan porfolio size and delinquency.

VERY IMPORTANT: There is a "$path" definition inside the mysqldump-cronjob.php script, make sure to set
the $path that corresponds to your setup.

The script creates a full database backup (prebk.gz), updates several tables, then creates another full db backup (postbk.gz).
Backups will be saved to /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/emms/acro/backup/ (or whatever your real path is) so make sure to allow
your system write permissions to this folder.

You should consider downloading these backups everyday as EMMS will overwrite them everytime the script is run.
Though unlikely to happen, if anything fails during a scheduled script run (ie., server shutdown, max_execution_time
exceded, etc.) you will not be able to login, should you restore your db using your more recent prebk.gz db backup
so you can check and run the script again in a controlled scenario.

In a development environment it could be handy to set force_run_mode = "normal" in the conf.ini file, this bypasses
the need for the scheduled script process, but note that some reports will be outdated. Whenever you change/update
the conf.ini or menu.xml files you must remove all the content inside /var/www/vhosts/mydomain.com/emms/tmp.

5. Installing db schema with sample content in a windows development workstation

   a. Download the database schema with sample content from http://code.google.com/p/emms/downloads/list
      The file name should be something like emms.db.sample-v2.5x.tar.gz
      Make sure to download the right version for your EMMS installation, version in the example above is v2.5x.

   b. Drop all tables, views and triggers from your database, then restore it using the file from step above.

   c. Run the scripts listed below:
        c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\httpdocs\emms\acro\db\views.sql
        c:\PathToXamppHtdocs\php\httpdocs\emms\acro\db\triggers.sql
      Note: Actual paths may be different depending on your setup

   d. Set force_run_mode = "normal" in your conf.ini and delete all content inside your tmp folder.
      For additional info on this step, read the "Setup your task scheduler - cron"

   e. In order to login EMMS you need username/password. Run query below then you can use: admin/123456
      Query: UPDATE tblUsers SET password = 'e1y.tuEXKZRRE' WHERE username = 'admin';
